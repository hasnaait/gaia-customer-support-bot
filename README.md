## What is GCS Bot ?
_GCS_ is a customer support bot that helps businesses answer frequently asked questions so customer support agents can focus on more complicated issues.

##### Example, 
if you are building a chat bot using IBM watson, it might not have much intelligence(No offence IBM, infact all the frameworks are similar) but if you try to understand the technology ,methods the IBM watson used to win the game called jeopardy , you will be amazed.
here IBM watson is one of the best Q&A systems ( I am not talking about chatbot here cause for the chatbot, IBM watson is normal like any other tool).
I hope it is not confusing , even if it is.. you will get the idea as you read through.

 

##  Language :

<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: canter;">
      <th>Language</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>ENGLISH</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>FRENCH</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

## THE PLAN :

1.   What is NLP?
        - Natural language processing or NLP is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data
3.   How GCS works ?
        - It's an intuitive behavior used to convey information and meaning with semantic cues such as words, signs, or images. ... While the terms AI and NLP might conjure images of futuristic robots, there are already basic examples of NLP at work in our daily lives.
5.   Why it is important?
        - Natural language processing helps computers communicate with humans in their own language and scales other language-related tasks. For example, NLP makes it possible for computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important.
8.   Load Dependencies
        - nltk, torch, numpy, langdetect
11.   Basic Named Entity (NE) tagging using NLTK
        -   Word Based
        -   Sentence Based
