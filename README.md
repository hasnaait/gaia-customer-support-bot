<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: canter;">
      <th>Language</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

## THE PLAN :

1.   What is NLP?
        - Natural language processing or NLP is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data
3.   How GCS works ?
        - It's an intuitive behavior used to convey information and meaning with semantic cues such as words, signs, or images. ... While the terms AI and NLP might conjure images of futuristic robots, there are already basic examples of NLP at work in our daily lives.
5.   Why it is important?
        - Natural language processing helps computers communicate with humans in their own language and scales other language-related tasks. For example, NLP makes it possible for computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important.
8.   Load Dependencies
        - nltk, torch, numpy, langdetect
11.   Basic Named Entity (NE) tagging using NLTK
        -   Word Based
        -   Sentence Based
